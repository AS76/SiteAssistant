title: Site diary
description: Record the shift plan and results, and how the operational day works.
---

The **diary** tells the story of every shift: what was planned, what was actually done, which impediments came up and what is handed over to the next shift. It is a handover, not a formal record.

## Where it is

The **Diary** view shows the entries of the selected site for the chosen **operational day**. From here you open the **Add contribution** form.

## Record an entry

From the **Add contribution** button:

| Field | Required | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Shift | Yes | `day` or `night` |
| Plan | No | What was planned for the shift |
| Actual results | No | What was actually executed |
| Blockers | No | Impediments, interferences, variances |
| Next step | No | What is handed over to the next shift |

The operational day is computed by the application from the site and the time. There is **one entry per site, day and shift**: a second entry on the same combination is rejected.

## Photos and documents

In the **Add contribution** form, the **Photos or documents** box attaches images and PDFs to the entry:

- drop the files from the desktop into the box, or tap the box and pick them;
- you can attach several files;
- each file can be an image or a PDF, up to **15 MiB**.

Uploading attachments is reserved to **owners** and **editors**. Files are attached after the entry is saved. If the entry stays queued because you are offline, the photos are not attached: the application says so and the entry is saved anyway. In that case attach the photos when you are back online.

A saved entry shows its attachments and the **Add photo or PDF** button.

## The operational day

The operational day does not start at midnight:

- it starts at the configured cutoff time, by default **06:00** in the **Europe/Rome** timezone;
- it ends at 05:59:59 of the following day;
- a night shift belongs to the day it started on.

Example: a night shift starting on 12 November at 22:00 and ending on the 13th at 06:00 is recorded on **12 November**.

## Printing

The **Print diary** button uses the browser's print dialog. There is no server-generated PDF and no archive of prints.

- Editing or deleting an entry after saving.
