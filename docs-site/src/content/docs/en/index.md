This documentation explains **how to use SiteAssistant on site**: what you can do, step by step, and what you cannot. It is written for people working in the field — Site Managers, foremen, reviewers — and for those who administer users and sites.

If you know what you are looking for, use the **search** box at the top: it indexes every page, in Italian and English.

## Why SiteAssistant exists

SiteAssistant comes from first-hand experience managing industrial and intralogistics construction sites. In those environments, information, tasks, reviews and reporting often live in separate tools — spreadsheets, email, different apps — and whoever coordinates the site spends time putting them back together.

It is not an ERP, and it does not want to be one. It is the layer that is missing between the plan and the daily reality of the site: a single place to know what needs doing, who is doing it, what has been verified, and what happened today.
