title: Data assistant
description: Ask questions about the site data and open the cited records.
---

The **data assistant** answers questions about the selected site's data. It reads records and writes nothing: changes stay in the modules, where you confirm them.

## Where it is

After signing in, the **AI** button appears at the bottom right. Open it for the **Data assistant** panel.

The panel contains:

- the conversation;
- suggestions for the current view;
- the **Ask about this site's data** field and the **Send** button.

On the sign-in screen the button is not there.

## The suggestions

Suggestions change with the open view. Some examples:

- in Overview: "What is late on this site?";
- in Tasks: "How many tasks are waiting for verification?";
- in Deviations: "Which deviations are still open?";
- in Site progress: "Which items are behind plan?";
- in Time bookings: "How many hours have been booked in total?";
- in Cost impacts: "How much has been claimed and settled?";
- in Diary: "What was recorded in the diary yesterday?".

You can also type your own question.

## The answers

Answers are short and cite the records used, with the code in square brackets: `[DEV-014]`, `[WBS 2.1]`.

Citations are buttons: they open the record detail when that record type has a detail in the interface. For tasks, diary and work structure the reference stays a label.

## The language

The assistant answers in the interface language:

- Italian interface: it answers in Italian;
- English interface: it answers in English.

Record codes stay the same.

## What it sees

- Only the **selected site**.
- Only the data your role can consult.
- Records from deviations, site progress, cost impacts, time bookings, tasks, diary and project structure.

It does not see other sites and does not read the content of photos and PDFs.

## What it does not do

- **It does not write**: it does not create, edit or close records. If you ask for a change, it points to the screen to use.
- **It does not invent**: if a piece of data is missing, it says it is not in the data.
- **It does not compute totals it did not query**: the numbers in the answers come from queries on the data.

## Practical limits

- A connection is required: questions go through the server.
- The conversation stays while the page is open; reloading starts from scratch.
- If the assistant is not configured on the server, the panel shows an error.
- Questions and the returned records are sent to the model provider configured on the server. Do not enter confidential information.
